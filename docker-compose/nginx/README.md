# Setting Up Nginx with Let's Encrypt SSL Certificates Using Docker

This guide will help you set up **Nginx** with **Let's Encrypt** SSL certificates using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**. Follow these step-by-step instructions to configure your environment so that other developers can easily onboard and run the project.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your system.
- A domain name pointing to your server's IP address.
- Ports **80** and **443** open on your server's firewall.

---

## Project Structure

```
project/docker-compose/nginx
├── docker-compose.yml
├── default.conf
└── letsencrypt/  # This directory will store Certbot logs
```

---

## Step 1: Set Up the `docker-compose.yml` File

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.4'

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:stable-alpine
    container_name: nginx
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    networks:
      - microservice-network
    volumes:
      - ~/work/nginx/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
      - certs:/etc/letsencrypt
      - certbot-www:/var/www/certbot

  certbot:
    image: certbot/certbot
    container_name: certbot
    volumes:
      - certs:/etc/letsencrypt
      - certbot-www:/var/www/certbot
      - ~/work/nginx/letsencrypt:/var/log/letsencrypt
    networks:
      - microservice-network
    command: [
      "certonly",
      "--webroot",
      "--webroot-path=/var/www/certbot",
      "--email", "your-email@example.com",
      "--agree-tos",
      "--no-eff-email",
      "-d", "your-domain.com"
    ]

networks:
  microservice-network:
    external: true

volumes:
  certs:
  certbot-www:
```

**Notes:**

- The `nginx` service uses the official `nginx:stable-alpine` image.
- The `default.conf` file is mounted directly from the host machine.
- The `certbot` service is configured to obtain SSL certificates.
- Replace `your-email@example.com` and `your-domain.com` with your actual email and domain name.

---

## Step 2: Create the Nginx Configuration File

Create a `default.conf` file at `~/work/nginx/default.conf` with the following content:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/certbot;
    }

    location / {
        return 200 'Temporary Nginx Server';
        add_header Content-Type text/plain;
    }
}
```

**Notes:**

- This configuration allows Nginx to serve the necessary files for Let's Encrypt domain verification.
- Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain name.

---

## Step 3: Create Necessary Directories

Ensure the directories for mounting volumes exist on your host machine:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/work/nginx/letsencrypt
```

---

## Step 4: Create the Docker Network

If the `microservice-network` does not exist, create it using:

```bash
docker network create microservice-network
```

---

## Step 5: Start Nginx Without SSL Configuration

We will first run Nginx without SSL to allow Let's Encrypt to verify the domain ownership.

1. **Start Nginx:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d nginx
   ```

2. **Verify Nginx Is Running:**

   ```bash
   docker ps
   docker logs nginx
   ```

3. **Test Nginx:**

   Visit `http://your-domain.com` in your browser. You should see a page displaying "Temporary Nginx Server".

---

## Step 6: Obtain SSL Certificates Using Certbot

Run Certbot to obtain SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt:

```bash
docker-compose run certbot
```

**Notes:**

- Certbot will use the `webroot` method to verify domain ownership.
- If successful, certificates will be stored in the `certs` volume.

---

## Step 7: Update Nginx Configuration with SSL

Now that we have obtained the SSL certificates, update the `default.conf` file to configure SSL:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/certbot;
    }
    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_pass http://api-gateway:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
    }
}
```

**Notes:**

- The server now listens on port 443 with SSL enabled.
- HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.
- Replace `your-backend-service` and `port` with your backend service's hostname and port.
- Ensure that the SSL certificate paths match the ones generated by Certbot.

---

## Step 8: Reload Nginx with SSL Configuration

1. **Restart Nginx:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose restart nginx
   ```

2. **Verify Nginx Is Running Without Errors:**

   ```bash
   docker logs nginx
   ```

---

## Step 9: Test HTTPS Access

Visit `https://your-domain.com` in your browser to verify:

- The SSL certificate is valid.
- The site loads correctly.
- HTTP requests are properly redirected to HTTPS.

---

## Step 10: Set Up Automatic Certificate Renewal

Let's Encrypt certificates expire every 90 days. Set up a cron job to automatically renew the certificates:

1. **Open Crontab Editor:**

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. **Add the Following Line:**

   ```cron
   0 0 * * * docker-compose run certbot renew --quiet && docker-compose exec nginx nginx -s reload
   ```

**Notes:**

- This cron job runs daily at midnight to check for certificate renewal.
- If certificates are renewed, Nginx is reloaded to apply the new certificates.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Firewall Configuration:**

  Ensure that ports 80 and 443 are open in your server's firewall settings.

- **DNS Settings:**

  Your domain name must point to your server's public IP address.

- **File Permissions:**

  Ensure that the user running Docker has permission to access the mounted directories and files.

- **Backend Service:**

  Make sure that `your-backend-service` is reachable from the Nginx container, possibly by adding it to the same Docker network.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Nginx Not Starting:**

  Check the logs for errors:

  ```bash
  docker logs nginx
  ```

- **Certbot Errors:**

  View Certbot logs for more details:

  ```bash
  cat ~/work/nginx/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
  ```

- **Cannot Access Site via HTTPS:**

  Ensure that the SSL certificates are correctly installed and that Nginx is configured to use them.

---

## Useful Commands

- **Bring Up Services:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- **Stop Services:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

- **View Running Containers:**

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

- **Execute Command in Running Container:**

  ```bash
  docker exec -it nginx sh
  ```
